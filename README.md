# anomaly_detection_spectral_methods
Creates a network with various stochastic block model (SBM) background community structures and a planted anomaly. Uses spectral clustering to detect the nodes of the anomaly and compares to random matrix theory utilizing non-negative matrix factorization. Plots various analysis metrics.
